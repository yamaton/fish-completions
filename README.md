## Install
Just put the `.fish` files in the directory `~/.config/fish/completions`. [This script](https://github.com/yamaton/fish-completions-bio/blob/main/install.sh) downloads the [released package](https://github.com/yamaton/fish-completions-bio/releases), and extracts to the directory.
```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yamaton/fish-completions-bio/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Support for more files?

I generated fish scripts in this repository using [my program](https://github.com/yamaton/h2o) extracting information from help/man pages. Just [post](https://github.com/yamaton/fish-completions-bio/issues/1) a request for further additions.
